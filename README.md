# Data Descriptor

This repository contains: 1) original datasets analyzed in MICA project published papers (`/data_original`), 2)  processing notebooks to prepare data for Level 1 curation at ICPSR (`/notebooks`), 3) and processed files for internal review (`/data_transform`) to publish as a replication dataset for a Nature Scientific Data article.

**Steps**
- [x] Pre-process and prepare tables by merging project admin data (`/notebooks/transform-data.ipynb`)
- [x] Request review by Data Stewardship Committee - discuss whether data can be shared as they are or will require additional transformation
- [ ] Pre-curate data in SPSS to expedite publication - document variables in a codebook, address missing values, add variable labels using definitions below
- [ ] Request Level 1 curation for deposit in ICPSR General Archive

**Usage Notes**
* Study release date (earliest: 1984) is inaccurate
* Publication dates (missing or < 1963) recoded to 0
* Missing study description text ("nan") replaced with empty string ("")
* Worklogs are split on new line (many to one per Jira ticket) and classified
* This dataset contains data from different pulls, so some variables are null for most studies (e.g., SINGLE_PI, INST_PI)
* There are studies with negative numbers for TOTAL_VARS, likely from missing value designations (need to document)
